 # Lecture 109 - Sets & HashSet

[_Link_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html)

Sets are less often used than lists and maps that they can in themselves be useful

List is an ordered collection of items than can have duplicates , whereas a Set has no defined ordering (oracle 
documentation defined it as chaotic) But secondly as Set cannot have duplicates, there are ordered sets as well such 
as link hash set and tree set.

If you want to ensure that there are no duplicates in your collection than Set is best choice rather than a List.
