# Lecture 186 - Buffered Writer and Challenge

Challenge: 

**PART 1:**<br/>

Modify the program so that it uses a _BufferedReader_ to read in the locations data.

Run the program to test it before on to Part 2.

**PART 2:**<br/>

Modify the main method of the Locations class so that it uses a _BufferedWriter_ to write the data.

Open the locations.txt and directions.txt files to check that the data has been written successfully.

You will then need to make another change to the program to allow for the 0 (Quit) exits before using the newly 
created files.

**Hint:** You may want to change the three instances of HashMap to LinkedHashMap in the Location class and one 
instance in the Locations class so that you compare the files more easily.
