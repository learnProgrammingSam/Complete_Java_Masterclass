# Lecture 175 - Basic Input and Output including java.util

This Lecture Talks about introduction to Exceptions in Java

Two main Approaches to handle errors which are LBYL and EAFP.

LBYL: Look Before You Leap
LBYL is more common in Java (Like checking for null object)

EAFP: Easy to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission
This approach is to go ahead and perform the operation then respond to an
exception. So, if Something goes wrong so trapping and handling exceptions 
is pretty simple.

Both Approaches are good, depending upon usecase, but LBYL is more common

We can write many lines in a try block
