# Lecture 97 - The final Statement

> _final_ keyword is usually used to define constant values <br />
> _final_ fields are _not_ actually constants, as they can be modified but only _**once**_, any modification must be 
performed before the class constructor finishes, i.e. while declaring the field or in constructor <br />
> If a class is marked as _final_ it prevents the class from being sub-classed so, a final class _cannot_ be 
extended <br />
> If a class method is marked as _final_ then that method cannot be overridden in subsequent sub-class <br />
