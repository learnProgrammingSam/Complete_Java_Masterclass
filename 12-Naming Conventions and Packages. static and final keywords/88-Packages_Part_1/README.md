# Lecture 88 - Packages

## Packages <a name="packages">
> Over 9 million Java developers worldwide <br />
> Class or interface name conflicts are inevitable <br />
> Mechanism is need to fully specify class <br />
> Allow use of classes with the same name in the same project (or, even, the same class) <br />
> Package is a way of ___grouping___ related classes and interfaces together <br />
> Package mechanism provides a way to manage the _namespace_ of object types and it also extends 
> access protection <br />

### Some reasons to use packages are: 
> Programmers can easily determine that the classes are related <br />
> It is easy to know where to find the classes and interfaces that can provide the functions provided by the package <br />
> Because the package creates a new namespace, class and interface name <u>_conflicts_</u> are avoided<br />
> Classes withing the package can have unrestricted access to one another while still restricting
> access for classes outside the package<br />
