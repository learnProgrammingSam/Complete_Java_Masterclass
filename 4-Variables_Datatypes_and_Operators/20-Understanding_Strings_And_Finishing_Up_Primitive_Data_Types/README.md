# Understanding Strings and Finishing Up Primitive Data Types

In addition to the eight primitive data types listed above, the Java programming language also provides special support for character strings via the java.lang.String class. <br />
Enclosing your character string within double quotes will automatically create a new String object <br />
for example, `String s = "this is a string";` <br />
String objects are **immutable**, which means that once created, their values _cannot_ be changed. <br />
The String class is not technically a primitive data type, but considering the special support given to it by the language, you'll probably tend to think of it as such. <br />
