# Primitive Data Types
> The Java programming language is statically-typed, which means that all variables must first be declared before they can be used. This involves stating the variable's type and name: <br />
> `int gear = 1;`

## Numeric Primitive Data Types
> All types are singed <br />
> Ranges are defined using following: <br />
`-2^(n-1) to (2^(n-1))-1` <br />
>, here n is number of bits used to store data type variable


|   Type	  |  Bytes(bits n)	|	Range  	    |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
|	byte	    |	1 (8)		        |   -128 to 127 |
|	short	    |	2 (16)	 	      |   -32768 to 32767|
|	int		    |	4 (32)		      |   -214783648 to 214783647 |
|	long	    |	8 (64)	 	      |    -(2^63) to (2^63)-1|
