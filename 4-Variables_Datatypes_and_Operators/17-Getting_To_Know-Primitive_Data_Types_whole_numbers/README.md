# Primitive Data Types
> The Java programming language is statically-typed, which means that all variables must first be declared before they can be used. This involves stating the variable's type and name: <br />
> `int gear = 1;`

## Numeric Primitive Data Types
> Ranges are defined using, here n is number of bits used to store data type variable: <br />

`-2^(n-1) to (2^(n-1))-1`

|   Type	|  Bytes(bits)	|	Range  	|
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
|	byte	|	1 (8)		|		   	|
|	short	|	2 (16)	 	|			|
|	int		|	4 (32)		|			|
|	long	|	8 (64)	 	|			|
|			|			 	|			|
